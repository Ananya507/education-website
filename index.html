                <p class="text-small">While edtech as a sector has grown tremendously in the past decade, the true impact of its effective application is only now becoming clear. From e-learning platforms, student engagement tools in the classroom, to skill development and continuous learning opportunities for higher education, EdTech has played a significant role in transforming the way knowledge is accessed. In addition to this, the positive government policies and the tech innovations brought about by wide spread internet penetration and the advent of 5G, have further accelerated the transformation of the sector.</p>
                <p class="text-small">There is no doubt that there will be significant educational reforms in 2023 as a result of the new National Education Policy (NEP). STEM-based learning will experience a big push during the next few years as skill-based education picks up speed. In terms of school education, there have been a lot of focused policy developments that have been designed keeping tech enabled solutions in mind, with the objective of driving digital literacy and inclusiveness in terms of access to quality learning methods. As NEP embarks on its voyage, all school curriculum will experience considerable changes as experiential learning gains popularity. Schools will soon start implementing programs with the primary goal of making learning pleasurable.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Technology is developing, and we have reached a brand-new era when augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are quickly gaining traction. Because of virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, children now have a space where they can understand complicated ideas and gain practical learning experiences in low-risk virtual environments. STEM-related classes, simulations of medical procedures, resources in the arts and humanities, technical education, AR, and VR all have the potential to improve it. The capacity to communicate knowledge in novel and more interesting ways online is the second reason why virtual reality and augmented reality technologies are on their way to becoming one of the most promising additions to the “Edtech” field.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Rise of Real and AI together</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, can communicate with humans and provide assistance. It has the potential to alter a wide number of sectors, including education, and to solve some of the most pressing challenges facing education today by introducing novel approaches to teaching and learning. The use of AI tools and technology may provide benefits such as faster paper grading, tailored training, intelligent material delivery, and student access to tutoring programs or AI-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). Realizing that AI should be centered on people is vital. Giving students a sustainable and high-quality education in the future will be made possible by a mix of teachers’ involvement and AI.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Personalized Education</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Personalizing learning for each student’s strengths, needs, talents, and interests is yet another straightforward yet very successful and novel approach to the learning process. This aids in creating a learning plan specifically for the learner. The fundamental idea behind introducing customized learning is that every kid learns in a unique way and at a unique speed. Each student in customized learning receives a ‘learning plan’ based on their learning style, prior knowledge, abilities, and interests. It goes against the ‘one size fits all’ philosophy that is prevalent in most schools. In order to ensure that the student obtains hands-on learning on the selected topics and that they’re expected to learn as they move through their education, the developed plan is kept project-based.</p>
